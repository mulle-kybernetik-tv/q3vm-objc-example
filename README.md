# q3vm-objc-example

This is a small demo project, that demonstrates calling Objective-C from
within the [Q3VM](https://github.com/jnz/q3vm).

The Q3VM files vm.h and vm.c have their own license.


## How to build

This is a [mulle-sde](https://mulle-sde.github.io/) project.

It has it's own virtual environment, that will be automatically setup for you
once you enter it with:

```
mulle-sde q3vm-objc-example
```

Now you can let **mulle-sde** fetch the required dependencies and build the 
project for you:

```
mulle-sde craft
```

## Additional requirement

Check out `https://github.com/jnz/q3vm`  alongside it and `make` it:

```
$ ls
q3vm
q3vm-objc-example
```
